### Task Management System

#### **Overview**
This project consists of developing a Task Management System that allows users to register, log in, create, update, delete, and manage tasks effectively. The system will utilize Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL with an optional frontend for user interaction.

### Day-by-Day Schedule for One Week

#### **Day 1: Project Setup and User Management**
- **Project Setup:**
  - Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
  - Add necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL Driver, Lombok).
- **Database Configuration:**
  - Set up a MySQL database (name it `task_management_db`).
  - Create a configuration file (`application.yml`) to define the connection settings and JPA properties.
- **User Management:**
  - Design and create the `User` entity with fields for username, password, and roles.
  - Plan the methods in the UserController for user registration and login endpoints.

#### **Day 2: User Registration and JWT Implementation**
- **User Registration:**
  - Implement logic for user registration, including password hashing (use BCrypt).
  - Create and document an endpoint for user registration.
- **JWT Implementation:**
  - Implement authentication functionality.
  - Generate a JWT token upon successful login and secure other API endpoints with it.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for User registration and login features to ensure proper functionality.

#### **Day 3: Task Entity and CRUD Operations**
- **Task Entity:**
  - Define the `Task` entity with necessary properties (title, description, priority, status, and category).
  - Establish a relationship between `User` and `Task` (one-to-many).
- **CRUD Functionality:**
  - Implement the TaskRepository and TaskService.
  - Create RESTful endpoints in TaskController for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
  
#### **Day 4: Task Management Features**
- **Categorization and Status Management:**
  - Implement categorization for tasks (e.g., Work, Personal).
  - Add functionality for updating the status of tasks (e.g., Pending, Completed).
- **Search and Filter Functionality:**
  - Develop search capabilities that allow users to filter tasks based on title, status, and category.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests for task management functionalities.

#### **Day 5: Exception Handling, Swagger Documentation, and Optimization**
- **Exception Handling:**
  - Implement global exception handling to manage errors gracefully and return meaningful messages.
- **Swagger Integration:**
  - Set up Swagger for API documentation, documenting endpoints for both User and Task features.
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Review and optimize SQL queries for efficiency.
  - Consider indexing fields that are commonly queried.
  
#### **Day 6: Caching and Frontend Setup (Optional)**
- **Caching:**
  - Implement caching strategies for tasks, especially for frequently accessed data.
  - Choose the appropriate caching mechanism (e.g., in-memory cache).
- **Frontend Setup:**
  - If including a frontend, create a new React project or Angular project for user interaction.
  - Install necessary libraries for HTTP requests (e.g., Axios for React).
  
#### **Day 7: Final Touches, Deployment, and Documentation**
- **Final Review:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase, refactoring any areas that require optimization.
- **Deployment Preparation:**
  - Prepare the application for deployment (consider creating a Docker container).
  - Decide on a cloud host for deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or local server).
- **Documentation:**
  - Complete the project README file detailing setup instructions, features, API documentation, and any configuration steps needed to run the application.
